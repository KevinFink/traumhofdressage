        <p> Although our primary focus here at Traumhof is ongoing training
          of our boarders and their horses by our in-house trainers, we also
          offer regular clinics by outside experts. Our boarders get top
          priority for riding in (and always get free auditing of) these clinics, but we do invite
          other riders to apply for riding slots, and always welcome auditors
          from the dressage community at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to great learning experiences, we try to make our clinics
          fun - we usually have a dinner or party afterwards so everyone can get to know
          the clinician and the other participants in a more casual atmosphere.

	  The 2013 Traumhof Clinic Series continues on the weekend of July 27th with
    Lientje Schueler, Assistant Trainer at S.  Peters Dressage.
	  Lientje started riding as a child in her home town of Oldenburg,
	  Germany, started dressage at age 12, and has been riding and
	  training ever since.  She has been the Assistant Trainer for
	  Shannon and Steffen for the past 8 years.  Her website, <a
	  href="http://trainandcompete.com/">TrainAndCompete.com</a>,
	  has more information including pictures and videos of her
	  riding.
	</p>

    <p>
	  We have plenty of space for auditors and it should be an
	  excellent learning opportunity to watch Lientje teach some
	  of the best riders in the Pacific Northwest!  We will be
	  charging $35 per day (or $60 for the weekend if you sign up
	  and pay ahead of time) for auditing.  <a
	  href="/cgi-bin/submit_audit_registration.pl">Click here</a>
	  to sign up.
	</p>

	<p> Please join us for this educational and fun weekend!
	</p>

	<p>We will be having a barbecue on the patio Saturday evening.
	   Everyone is welcome, but please RSVP on the <a
	   href="/cgi-bin/submit_audit_registration.pl">auditing
	   registration form</a> so we get the appropriate amount of
	   food.

        Horse & Rider Biographies for Lientje Schueler Clinic, July 2013
      </h1>

      <div class="paragraph_style_2">

<p>
Nicki Grandia is riding Unycus, an 11 yo Dutch Warmblood stallion by Grafiet out of
Octrola, owned by Linda Smyth. “Uno” just switched to dressage last year, but has
already had great success at 3rd & 4th level, including winning his
very-large class at Dressage at Devonwood last weekend!  Nicki is
the USDF Bronze, Silver, and Gold Medalist trainer here at Traumhof.
</p>

<p>
Nicki is also riding Chopin
</p>

<p>
Jessica Lyman is riding Rudeau, Elisienne's 9 year old son by Ruffian
(x Rubenstein).  While the pair has known each other for Rudi's
entire life (Jessica bred him), she has just started riding him.
</p>

<p>
Ruth Boozer is riding Ron, a 15 year old, imported KWPN by Flemmingh.  
Ruth says, "I am an adult amateur that has been riding for more
years than I care to remember.  I am passionate about dressage even
if I am not always proficient!  I board here at Traumhof and train
with the ever patient Nicki Grandia.  Ron came to dressage later
in life having decided that his first career, show jumping was not
his cup of tea!  I have owned him for almost two years and with
Nicki’s help, I am trying to convince him that dressage is fun!  We
are working at First / Second level.  Ron is a very “in your pocket”
gelding and definitely the barn clown!"
</p>

<p>
Suzanne Beaudoin is riding Avalanche, a 15 year old Westfalian mare
by Ferro x Argentinus.  Suzanne says, "I've owned "Ava" for 3 years.
She was a broodmare with almost no showing when I got her.  We
showed PSG this past year.  My goals are to get to GP before I'm
70 :) which is only 9 years away.  I hope to get there in 5 years.
We'll see :)."
</p>

<p>
Teresa Stewart is riding Percy, a 14 year old Irish Thoroughbred.
Teresa says, "Percy and I started to train solely dressage five
years ago.  I began showing at first level.  This year I have been
showing Intermediare-1 scoring 63-67% depending on the day but
improving as the season has gone on.  We are playing with half
steps.  Our goals are continued improvement of the basics, rider
position, better test riding, and ultimately to show Grand Prix.
Prior to my transition to dressage I was an event rider training
and competing in NY/FL.  Solid FEI 2* rider with three horses
developing for 3-4*.  Percy was one of those horses.  It has been
a bit challenging to go from an adrenaline sport to one of calmness.
I have worked through many confidence and tension issues with Percy
but it is a continual journey.
</p>

<p>
Linda Grandia is riding Farthing, a 3rd level Holsteiner gelding
by Fabio I out of London Choice.  The pair is training and showing
third level.  Linda Grandia teaches and trains at Hilltop Stables
in Woodinville and is the proud mother of 3 equestrian children:
Annie, Mark and Nicki Grandia.
