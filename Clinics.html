        <p> Although our primary focus here at Traumhof is ongoing training
          of our boarders and their horses by our in-house trainers, we also
          offer regular clinics by outside experts. Our boarders get top
          priority for riding in or auditing these clinics, but we do invite
          other trainers to apply for riding slots, and open
          auditing to the dressage community at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to great learning experiences, we try to make our clinics
          fun - we usually have a dinner or party afterwards so everyone can get to know
          the clinician and the other participants in a more casual atmosphere.

    <p>
	  The 2013 Traumhof Clinic Series continues on the weekend of April 13th with
    Lientje Schueler, Assistant Trainer at S.  Peters Dressage.
	  Lientje started riding as a child in her home town of Oldenburg,
	  Germany, started dressage at age 12, and has been riding and
	  training ever since.  She has been the Assistant Trainer for
	  Shannon and Steffen for the past 8 years.  Her website, <a
	  href="http://trainandcompete.com/">TrainAndCompete.com</a>,
	  has more information including pictures and videos of her
	  riding.
	</p>

    <p>
	  We have plenty of space for auditors and it should be an
	  excellent learning opportunity to watch Lientje teach some
	  of the best riders in the Pacific Northwest!  We will be
	  charging $35 per day (or $60 for the weekend if you sign up
	  and pay ahead of time) for auditing.  <a
	  href="/cgi-bin/submit_audit_registration.pl">Click here</a>
	  to sign up.
	</p>

	<p> Please join us for this educational and fun weekend!
	</p>

<!--
	<p>We will be having a barbecue on the patio Saturday evening.
	   Everyone is welcome, but please RSVP on the <a
	   href="/cgi-bin/submit_audit_registration.pl">auditing
	   registration form</a> so we get the appropriate amount of
	   food.

        Horse & Rider Biographies for Lientje Schueler Clinic, February 2013
      </h1>

      <div class="paragraph_style_2">

<p>
Danielle Tihon is riding Adagio, a 9 yo Swedish Warmblood gelding by Amiral out of
Deja Vu. They are training third level.
</p>

<p>
Nicki Grandia is riding Unycus, an 11 yo Dutch Warmblood stallion by Grafiet out of
Octrola, owned by Linda Smyth. “Uno” just switched to dressage last year, but has
already had great success at 3rd & 4th level over the summer show season.
Nicki is a USDF Bronze, Silver, and Gold Medalist trainer here at Traumhof.
</p>

<p>
Nicki is also riding Rudeau, Elisienne's 9 year old son by Ruffian
(x Rubenstein).
</p>

<p>
Paige Ruhl is riding Yahtzee, an (almost) 6 year old Friesian gelding
owned by Cathy Petrie.  Yahtzee is schooling Second level, and will
be showing First and probably Second this year.  And he is adorable.
</p>

<p>
Laurie Summers is riding Rosalyn (Roz), a Hanovarian mare out of
Regazzoni (out of Rubinstein I).  She is coming 8 this spring.  From
Laurie: "I purchased her this past September in Kelowna BC where
she had been in training for 1 year with a trainer who had her as
a sales project for a client who was unable to ride her.  She is a
very forward thinking mare with 3 quality gaits and a "can do,"
attitude.  We are working on basics at this point as we know she
has all the bells and whistles but needs some time with learning
to just listen to her rider and be patient.  She has very little
experience going beyond her own back yard and has never been shown.
We are hoping to get her to a place where she can rest and relax
and enjoy the moment.  She is very smart and fun to work with and
is quite a worker bee.  I look forward to being able to bring her
to Traumhof for her first clinic."
</p>

<p>
Jill Cheevers is riding Calvin (Cool Diamond), a 6 year old KWPN
gelding by Lingh.  He has not yet been shown.  From Jill: "I've
had him for 1.75 years.  He is sensitive and athletic so while the
work is not difficult for him, his ability to stay with me mentally
is more the challange.  Calvin has played with movements through
3rd level including green tempi changes and baby pirouettes.  My
goal for the clinic is to work on his connection and to see if he
can hold it together mentally.  As for me, I have studied dressage
primarily with Leslie Reid.  I enjoy bringing young horses up the
levels and have ridden through PSG/I1 on several horses." </p>

<p>
Shaun Meyers is riding Fryso, an 11 year old Friesian gelding.
From Shaun: "He and I have competed together through 2nd level.  We
are schooling 3rd and 4th level, with the exception of hitting a
roadblock with the changes.  We would like to work on continuing
to improve our connection and anything that would help further our
goal of the changes." </p>

<p>
Taylor Harper is riding Dora, a 12 year old Hanoverian mare, just
coming back from work after several years of being a broodmare.
They are working towards competing at 3rd level this show season.
Taylor has been involved with horses for 14+ years, dressage being
her main focus for the past 7 years.  </p>
