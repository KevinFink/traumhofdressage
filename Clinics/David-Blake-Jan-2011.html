    <h2 class="paragraph_style_2" style="margin-top: 0px;">Horse & Rider Biographies</h2>

    <p>
    Susan Gilbert is riding Mambo, a 14 yo warmblood gelding. They are
    currently schooling Training level and moving into First. They are
    working on the basics - not spooking or pulling, moving forward, paying
    attention to the rider, etc. Susan notes that she is one of the few who
    learned to ride as an adult, so has only been riding for the last eight
    years. Mambo used to be an eventer and has trained as far as Fourth
    level in the past, so Susan is looking forward to learning from him as
    they progress up the levels! Susan and Mambo train with Erin Morris at
    Traumhof.
    </p>

    <p>
    Danielle Odom is riding Nick, a 12 yo Welsh Cob / Thoroughbred cross.
    Danielle and Nick have been a team for five years. They competed at
    eventing for three years and competed at training and first level
    dressage last summer. Their project for this winter is relaxation!
    Danielle and Nick train with Nicki Grandia at Traumhof.
    </p>

    <p>
    Nicki Grandia is riding Rudeau, Elisienne's son by Ruffian (x
    Rubenstein). Rudi competed First level this year, including winning
    the Oregon Dressage Society's First Level Championship. He has been
    schooling Second level and is just starting Third. His biggest
    limitations are tension in the body and focus in the brain. Nicki is a
    USDF Bronze, Silver, and Gold Medalist trainer at Traumhof.
    </p>

    <p>
    Jillian Santi is riding Starwars TOF (Star), a 13 yo 14.1 hand Haflinger
    that she purchased when he was four. Jillian has personally trained Star
    to the FEI level and successfully competed at I-2 last year. Star was
    the first Haflinger to ever compete at an FEI level in the US and is
    believed to currently be the only Haflinger in the world to compete at
    I-2! Jillian hopes to show Grand Prix this year. Jillian and Star train
    with Nicki Grandia at Traumhof.
    </p>

    <p>
    Linda Grandia is riding Eloge II. Elo is a 19 yo Swedish Warmblood. He
    has trained and shown in the Northwest all of his life. Elo and Linda
    are currently showing 4th level and hope to move up to Prix St George
    this summer. Linda Grandia teaches and trains at Hilltop Stables in
    Woodinville and is the proud mother of 3 equestrian children, Annie,
    Mark and Nicki Grandia.
    </p>

    <p>
    Erin Morris is riding St. Anton, a 10 yo Finnish Warmblood gelding.
    Erin imported him from Germany as a 5 year old and has trained him up
    through Prix St George. The pair recently returned from a month training
    with Shannon Peters at Arroyo Del Mar. Erin is a USDF Bronze & Silver
    Medalist trainer at Traumhof.
    </p>

    <p>
    Siggi Wolff is riding French Kiss (Frenchi), a seven yo Westfalian
    by Florestan I. Her goals for the clinic are suppleness, overall
    submission, quicker responds to aids, and help on his changes by finding
    the best exercises to set him up. His primary challenge is to get
    quicker behind in the collected gaits. Siggi comments "Frenchi has come
    a long ways on the submission front but still has occasional outbursts
    :)"
    </p>

    <p>
    Alexander Holland is riding Wieneke Fan De Skarwei (Wieneke), a 11
    yo Friesian mare. His goal for the clinic is to work on developing
    lateral bend and collection, learn exercises for submission, and
    quicken response to aids. Alex adds "Wieneke is very willing to learn
    and intelligent. She sometimes has a mind of her own and bullies
    through aids. I would like to show her this season at first and
    possibly second level. She is 9 months into recovery from a prior
    suspensory injury." A big shout-out to Alex for winning the Devonwood
    Sportmanship award at Dressage at DevonWood last summer! Alex trains
    with Siggi Wolff.
