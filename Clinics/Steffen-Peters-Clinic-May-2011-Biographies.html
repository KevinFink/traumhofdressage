      </h1>

      <div class="paragraph_style_2">
					<p>
						Roanne Tyson is riding Seiltanz, 7 yr old gelding imported from Germany
						as a 4 yr old. He is an Oldenburg by Sunny Boy out of a Rohdiamont
						mare. He is schooling 4th level and they hope to show PSG by the end
						of the season. Last year they showed 3rd level and FEI 6 yr old tests
						with scores up to 75%. Roanne is an Equine Canada level 3 coach. She
						has trained two horses to Grand Prix and many to PSG. She runs a
						boarding/training barn with her sister. Her students are at all levels
						and range in age from 6 to 75 years old! She was a working student for
						Leslie Reid and then rode regularly with Dietrich Von Hopfgaarten for
						many years. She has taken clinics with Christilot Boylen, Udo Lange,
						Rudolf Zeilinger, Stephen Keiswetter, Conrad Schumacher, Ellen Bontje
						and Stephen Clark.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Lorraine Chappell is riding Carpatino, a 14 yr old Holsteiner gelding.
						The pair have been together since she purchased him in Germany 10 years
						ago and have been successfully competing at Grand Prix for several
						years. They have trained with a variety of great coaches, including
						Christine Traurig, Robert Dover, and of course Steffen! Lorraine is a
						Level 3 Coach from Aldergrove BC, is on the 2011 Dressage Canada Long
						List and is a declared rider for the Canadian WEG team.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Brooke Voldbaek is riding Donna Carina for Kerry and Maddy McKallip
						while Maddy is away at college. Donna is a 16 year old Hannovarian
						mare that has competed through I-1 and working this winter towards
						becoming a GP horse. Brooke has been a dressage rider and instructor for
						approximately 20 years and has been working out of Sonnenberg Farm in
						Sherwood, OR for 6 yrs. She has trained and shown many horses to the FEI
						levels.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Lindsey O'Keefe is riding Pirouette, a 9 year old Hanoverian gelding
						owned and bred by Krista Melby. Pirouette and Lindsey started their
						partnership in 2008, but he has been in Lindsey's training program
						with his owner since he was 4 years old. This partnership has had the
						wonderful opportunity of training at Steffen Peters' barn twice for
						training in the last year. In 2010, Lindsey and Pirouette were Region 6
						USDF/ABIC 2nd and 3rd level Champions. Pirouette is schooling 4th level
						and PSG.
					</p>
					
					<p>
            Lindsey is also riding Zwolle (aka "Astro"), a 7 year old Dutch gelding
            bred and owned by Dr. Mike Vanzwol. Astro has been with Lindsey since
            Oct 2010. Astro is just starting his Dressage career and Lindsey plans
            on showing him this year at 1st and 2nd level. Lindsey is a USDF Bronze,
            Silver and Gold Medalist and medaled 6 times combined at NAYRC and
            NAJYRC and placed third in the Brentina Cup in 2008.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Erin Morris is riding St. Anton, a 11 year old Finnish Warmblood, that
						she imported as a 5 year old. The pair spent the month of October 2010
						training with Shannon Peters at Arroyo Del Mar. They kicked off a full
						FEI season last weekend with a successful debut in I-1 at Devonwood.
						Their longer-term plan is for CDI competition in 2012. Erin is a USDF
						Silver Medalist trainer here at Traumhof.
					</p>
					
					<p>
            Nicki Grandia is riding Rudeau, Elisienne's 7 year old son by Ruffian
            (x Rubenstein). Last year they competed successfully at First Level,
            culminating in winning the ODS First Level Championship. The pair just
            returned from three months of intensive training with David Blake at
            Steffen's barn in CA where they also competed in three shows, finishing
            with a first place at Third level at the Del Mar National. They are
            particularly focused on Rudi's changes. Nicki is a USDF Bronze, Silver,
            and Gold Medalist trainer here at Traumhof.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					  Siggi Wolf is riding French Kiss, an 8 year old imported Westphalian
					  gelding by Florestan I. Frenchi was acquired as a 5 year old by clients
					  through the Westphalian auction in Germany. He is currently training
					  3rd/4th level. The plan is to take this year and focus on his training
					  rather than showing with the hopes to have a PSG horse next year. The
					  pair got a lot of help from David Blake, Raphael Heiligers, Shannon
					  Peters and Alfredo Hernandez to get Frenchi straighter, quicker,
					  stronger and above all more supple, rideable & obedient. Siggi is a
					  German Bereiter and runs Cavallis out of Shelburne Farm in Fall City
					(WA).
