<p>
  Several years ago (2011) we purchased a
  <a href="http://www.theraplate.com/" target="_new">TheraPlate</a>
   to help the rehab horses at Traumhof maintain muscle tone and
   bone density and to help them recover from various injuries.  We
   have been very pleased with the results, not only for these
   purposes but even more so in other areas.  For example, it has
   helped us resolve many mild colics (and some that appeared quite
   serious) with little or no vet intervention.  It has also helped
   reduce abcess recurrences in horses with a long history of chronic
   abcesses, healed hoof granulation where nothing else has helped,
   and accelerated hoof growth in multiple cases.
</p>

<p>
  Vibration therapy (and more specifically Whole Body Vibration,
  or WBV) has a <a href="/Theraplate_Studies.html">well-documented
  track record</a>, with hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, for
  helping both humans and animals recover from injuries as well as
  develop and maintain healthy bodies.  It's used in many of the
  top equine training programs across many disciplines.  We
  particularly like TheraPlate's 4 Zone Vortex Wave design for its
  zero impact experience.  Under the rubber top there are four
  separate metal plates, one for each of the horse's legs.  Each
  plate is driven in a horizontal circular motion by a separate
  motor.  The controller allows you to vary the frequency of this
  motion from 0 up to 100 Hz (cycles per second).  These fast, tiny
  circles vibrate the entire body, but there is no compression or
  rocking, so no risk of further injury or aggravating existing
  conditions.
</p>

<p>
  Whether the horses recognize the benefits or just like how it
  makes them feel, it's clear that they enjoy using our TheraPlate
  - they eagerly rush to it, step up onto the plate, and stand
  happily for the duration of their (typically 20 minute) session.
  We (and many of our clients) also enjoy using the TheraPlate
  ourselves, both to help relax sore muscles and to promote better
  fitness and health.

<p style="margin-top:0px">
  <strong>In fact, we have been so impressed with it we recently
  signed up to help distribute it!</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Because we, and the manufacturer, believe so strongly in its
  benefits, and want as many people (and more importantly, horses)
  as possible to have access to it, we are offering a free two-week
  trial at your facility.  The unit will be shipped directly to you
  and we will help you set it up (in person if you're in the Seattle
  area, on the phone otherwise).  In the unlikely event you decide
  it's not right for you, we'll have it picked up, all at no cost
  to you.
</p>

<p style="margin:0px">
  The equine version (two units that interconnect to create a 3'x7'
  platform) costs $5,999 (plus shipping and handling).  A variety
  of financing options are available, including an interest-free
  12 month payment schedule (on approved credit).
</p>
</div>

<p>
  In addition to the Equine model, several other units are available,
  ranging from smaller units sized for a single person up to
  full-stall installations.  See <a href="/Theraplate_Products.html">our
  TheraPlate Product page</a> for details.
