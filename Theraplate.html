<h3 style="clear:both">TheraPlate</h3>

<p>
  Several years ago (2011) we purchased a
  <a href="http://www.theraplate.com/" target="_new">TheraPlate</a>
   to help the rehab horses at Traumhof maintain muscle tone and
   bone density and to help them recover from various injuries.  We
   have been very pleased with the results, not only for these
   purposes but even more so in other areas.  For example, it has
   helped us resolve many mild colics (and some that appeared quite
   serious) with little or no vet intervention.  It has also helped
   reduce abcess recurrences in horses with a long history of chronic
   abcesses, healed hoof granulation where nothing else has helped,
   and accelerated hoof growth in multiple cases.
</p>

<p>
  Vibration therapy has a
  <a href="/Theraplate_Studies.html">well-documented track record</a>,
  with hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, for helping both humans
  and animals recover from injuries as well as develop and maintain
  healthy bodies.  It's used in many of the top equine training
  programs across many disciplines.
</p>

<p>
  Whether the horses recognize the benefits or just like how it
  makes them feel, it's clear that they enjoy using it - they eagerly
  rush to it, step up onto the plate, and stand happily for the
  duration of their (typically 20 minute) session.  We (and many
  of our clients) also enjoy using the TheraPlate ourselves, both
  to help relax sore muscles and to promote better fitness and
  health.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>In fact, we have been so impressed with it we recently
  signed up to help distribute it!</strong> Because we, and the
  manufacturer, believe so strongly in its benefits, and want as
  many people (and more importantly, horses) as possible to have
  access to it, we are offering a free two-week trial at your
  facility.  The unit will be shipped directly to you and we will
  help you set it up (in person if you're in the Seattle area, on
  the phone otherwise).  In the unlikely event you decide it's not
  right for you, we'll have it picked up, all at no cost to you.
</p>

<p>
  The equine version (two units that interconnect to create a 3'x7'
  platform) costs $6000 (plus shipping and handling).  A variety
  of financing options are available, including an interest-free
  12 month payment schedule (on approved credit).
