<h3 style="clear:both">TheraPlate Imaging</h3>

<p>
One of the primary therapeutic mechanisms of the TheraPlate is increasing
circulation, both immediately and long-term.  The short-term impact
can be seen via thermograms.  Here we see "Buck" imaged before and
during a session on the TheraPlate.  Notice the significant increase
in skin temperature across much of his body, particularly those
areas with large muscle mass.  This can be attributed to the increased
blood flow to those areas as the muscles react to the motion of the
TheraPlate.
</p>

<p>
While an immediate increase in circulation is not surprising, and
even obvious, (and can be quickly felt yourself just by stepping
up onto the platform), the longer-term impacts are arguably much
more important, particularly in horses with injuries or on stall
rest or other limited movement protocols.  While these effects are
attested to by many experiences we and others have had, certain
aspects of them can also be seen in venograms such as those shown
below.
</p>

<p>
The first picture is the venogram x-ray of the hoof of a foundered
4 year old mare.  This was taken on 9/14/2012 after 60 days of
traditional rehab treatment.  The mare was still lame and in danger
of being retired to the broodmare pen.
</p>

<img src="/TheraPlate/pictures/venogram_after.jpg">

<p>
The second picture shows the same hoof less than two months later
(11/10/2012), during which time she was on the TheraPlate twice a
day for 20 minutes each session.  The growth of blood vessels can
be easily seen in the image.  The circulation has improved 75% and
according to the treating vet, the rotation of the coffin bone
stopped.  And most importantly, the horse is sound.
